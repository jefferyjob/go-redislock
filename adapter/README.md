# Redis client adapter
go-redislock provides a highly scalable client adaptation mechanism, and has built-in support for the following mainstream Redis clients. For detailed examples, please refer to [examples](../examples/adapter) .

If the Redis client you are using is not in the above list, you can also implement the interface `RedisInter` to connect to any Redis client.
